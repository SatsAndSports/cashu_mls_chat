# MDK + Cashu Demo

A demonstration application combining **MDK (Marmot Development Kit)** (the implementation of MLS that is used in White Noise) for encrypted group messaging with **Cashu (CDK)** for ecash wallet functionality.

_**Built as part of the hackathon for the Bitcoin++ Lightning conference in Berlin in October 2025. This demo sets up three users in an MLS group, where they have the usual chat functionality. It's just a local process, with three 'fake' users messaging each other, but the messages use the MDK library to encrypt and sign the Nostr messages (kind 445 - MlsGroupMessage). Instead of using real public relays, those messages are just directly sent within the local process. This demo also includes a Cashu wallet (sqlite for the tokens) and users can use `!send 123` and `!redeemlast` and `!redeem cashuA...` commands to move cashu around in the group. Lots to do! Just a basic demo connecting `cdk` with `mdk`.**_

## Features

- **üîí End-to-End Encrypted Group Chat**: Three users (Alice, Bob, Carol) communicate via MLS (Message Layer Security) protocol
- **üí∞ Cashu Wallet Integration**: Each user has a persistent SQLite-backed ecash wallet
- **üéÅ Token Exchange**: Send and receive cashu tokens within the encrypted group chat
- **üì° Dual Mode**: Run in local simulation mode or connect to real Nostr relays
- **üñ•Ô∏è Graphical Interface**: Three-pane GUI showing all users simultaneously
- **üîç 3x Zoom**: Default 300% zoom for easy demo presentations

## Architecture

- **MDK (Marmot Development Kit)**: Provides MLS encryption and Nostr relay integration
- **CDK (Cashu Development Kit)**: Handles ecash wallet operations and token management
- **egui/eframe**: Cross-platform GUI framework
- **SQLite**: Persistent wallet storage in `./wallets/` directory

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.90.0 or later (specified in `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- Local clones of:
  - [MDK](https://github.com/parres-hq/mdk) in `./mdk/`
  - [CDK](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk) in `./cdk/`

## Building

```bash
cargo build
```

## Running

### Local Simulation Mode (Default)
```bash
cargo run
```

### Nostr Relay Mode
```bash
cargo run -- --relay
```

Configured relays:
- wss://relay.damus.io
- wss://nos.lol
- wss://relay.nostr.band
- wss://relay.primal.net
- wss://nostr.bitcoiner.social
- wss://nostr.mom
- wss://nostr.oxtr.dev

## Usage

### GUI Controls

- **Zoom In/Out**: Buttons in the top bar (default 3x zoom)
- **Send Message**: Type in the input box and press Enter or click Send
- **Balance Display**: Shows current wallet balance at top of each pane

### Special Commands

#### `!topup [amount]`
Request a Lightning invoice to add sats to your wallet.
- Opens a QR code popup window
- Default: 100 sats if no amount specified
- Example: `!topup 50`

#### `!redeem <TOKEN>`
Receive a cashu token into your wallet.
- Token format: starts with `cashuA` or `cashuB`
- Example: `!redeem cashuAeyJ0b2tlbiI...`

#### `!send [amount]`
Create a cashu token and broadcast it to the group via MLS.
- Default: 10 sats if no amount specified
- Token appears formatted: `[üéÅ Cashu Token: X sats from https://nofees.testnut.cashu.space]`
- Example: `!send 5`

#### `!redeemlast`
Automatically find and redeem the most recent cashu token from the chat.
- Searches backwards through messages
- Redeems the first cashu token found

## Mint Configuration

Currently using testnut mint (no real sats):
```
https://nofees.testnut.cashu.space
```

To change mint, edit `src/main.rs` line ~68.

## Wallet Storage

Wallets are persisted in SQLite databases:
- `./wallets/alice.db`
- `./wallets/bob.db`
- `./wallets/carol.db`

Balances are automatically restored on restart.

## Technical Details

### MLS Group Chat
- Uses OpenMLS via MDK for encryption
- Group ID is generated at startup
- In relay mode, messages are filtered by group ID using nostr `h` tag
- Forward secrecy and post-compromise security

### Cashu Integration
- Each wallet derived from user's Nostr keys
- Tokens are sent as encrypted MLS messages
- Two-step send process: `prepare_send()` ‚Üí `confirm()`
- Automatic balance updates after transactions

### Message Flow (Local Mode)
1. User types message ‚Üí MLS encryption
2. Encrypted message added to shared message queue
3. All users decrypt and display message

### Message Flow (Relay Mode)
1. User types message ‚Üí MLS encryption
2. Published to Nostr relays as kind 445 event
3. Subscription filter matches group ID
4. All users receive, decrypt, and display

## Example Workflow

1. Start the app: `cargo run`
2. Bob creates a 5-sat token: `!send 5`
3. Alice redeems it: `!redeemlast`
4. Carol requests funds: `!topup 100`
5. (Pay the Lightning invoice shown in QR code)
6. Carol sends to Alice: `!send 20`
